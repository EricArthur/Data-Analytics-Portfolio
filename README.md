# Data Science Portfolio

This is a space for all of the projects I have worked on. As someone with an intense curiosty for all things data, this portfolio is constantly getting updated as I find new and interesting data to explore. Click on the projects to see full analyses and code

## Projects:

### [NLP - Text Mining](https://github.com/EricArthur/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/NLP%20Text%20Mining/NLP%20-%20Text%20Mining.ipynb)
* Project that came about as a way to create word cloud of all of the texts between my girlfriend and I over the course of our relationship
* Utilized text-mining and NLP techniques to properly analyze and present data
* Was great exposure to working with a different/new form of data to me (text message/phone backup)

### [Designing & Creating a Database - MLB](https://github.com/EricArthur/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/MLB%20Database/Designing%20%26%20Creating%20a%20Database.ipynb)
* Created using file of Major League Baseball games from Retrosheet (https://www.retrosheet.org)
* Imported data into SQLite
* Designed a normalized database schema
* Created and inserted tables into schema

### [Soccer Database - EPL](https://github.com/EricArthur/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Soccer%20Database/Soccer%20Database%20-%20EDA.ipynb)
* European soccer database originally from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer)
* Framework for how to handle SQLite database in Python
* Analysis of Premier League over 8 seasons
* Will definitely revisit multiple times for other correlation exploration and match predicting

### [Finding the Best Markets to Advertise In](https://github.com/EricArthur/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Finding%20the%20Best%20Markets%20to%20Advertise%20In/Finding%20the%20Two%20Best%20Markets%20to%20Advertise%20In.ipynb)
* As an analyst for an e-learning company, determined the two best markets to run ad campaigns in
* Utilized freeCodeCamp's 2017 New Coder Survey as datasource

### [A/B Test For E-Commerce Website](https://github.com/EricArthur/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/A-B%20Test/A-B%20Test%20For%20E-Commerce%20Website.ipynb)
* Study to find out if a website should deploy new page or keep original design
* Display of different ways to perform analysis, through bootstrap sampling with replacement and utilization of statsmodel.api
* Statsmodel.api also used for fitting of logistic regression model

### [Predicting No-Show Patients](https://github.com/EricArthur/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/No-Show%20Doctor%20Appointments/Medical%20Appointments.ipynb)
* EDA of medical appointment dataset originally from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments)
* Study looks into several factors affecting whether patients will show up for appointment or not
* For now is more of a data visualization exercise: will revisit to utilize machine learning to accurately predict no-shows
