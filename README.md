# Data Science Portfolio

This is a space for all of the projects I have worked and will continually work one. As someone with an intense curiosty for all things data, this portfolio is constantly getting updated as I find new and interesting data to explore. Click on the projects to see full analyses and code

## Projects:

### [Soccer Database - EPL](https://github.com/EricArthur/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Soccer%20Database/Soccer%20Database%20-%20EDA.ipynb)
* European soccer database originally from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer)
* Framework for how to handle SQLite database in Python
* Analysis of Premier League over 8 seasons
* Will definitely revisit multiple times for other correlation exploration and match predicting

### [A/B Test For E-Commerce Website](link)
* Study to find out if a website should deploy new page or keep original design
* Display of different ways to perform analysis, through bootstrap sampling with replacement and utilization of statsmodel.api
* Statsmodel.api also used for fitting of logistic regression model

### [Predicting No-Show Patients](https://github.com/EricArthur/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/No-Show%20Doctor%20Appointments/Medical%20Appointments.ipynb)
* EDA of medical appointment dataset originally from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments)
* Study looks into several factors affecting whether patients will show up for appointment or not
* For now is more of a data visualization exercise: will revisit to utilize machine learning to accurately predict no-shows
