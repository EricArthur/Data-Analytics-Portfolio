# Data Analytics Portfolio

This is a space for all of the projects I have worked on. As someone with an intense curiosty for all things data, this portfolio is constantly getting updated as I find new and interesting data to explore. Click on the projects to see full analyses and code

## Projects:

### [NYC 311 Data Pipeline](https://github.com/EricArthur/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/tree/master/NYC%20311%20Data%20Pipeline)
* Fully orchestrated data pipeline via Airflow and housed within AWS ecosystem
* Data is sourced from NYC's Open Data API, migrated into an S3 bucket, and finally into a data warehouse hoseted on RDS
* Transformations occur and progress data through staging schema before finally being placed into production tables

### [Youtube to Spotify Playlist](https://github.com/EricArthur/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/tree/master/YoutubeToSpotifyPlaylist)
* create_playlist.py is a script that takes your liked videos from Youtube and adds them to a newly created playlist in Spotify
* Utilized APIs to access and create data between apps
* Great lesson in learning to interact with multiple APIs and juggling credentials/secrets in order to access needed data

### [NLP - Text Mining](https://github.com/EricArthur/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/NLP%20Text%20Mining/NLP%20-%20Text%20Mining.ipynb)
* Started as an aniversary gift to my girlfriend for our first year of dating
* Utilized text-mining and NLP techniques to properly analyze and present data
* Was great exposure to working with a different/new form of data to me (text message/phone backup)

### [Designing & Creating a Database - MLB](https://github.com/EricArthur/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/MLB%20Database/Designing%20%26%20Creating%20a%20Database.ipynb)
* Created using file of Major League Baseball games from Retrosheet (https://www.retrosheet.org)
* Imported data into SQLite
* Designed a normalized database schema
* Created and inserted tables into schema

### [Soccer Database - EPL](https://github.com/EricArthur/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Soccer%20Database/Soccer%20Database%20-%20EDA.ipynb)
* European soccer database originally from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer)
* Framework for how to handle SQLite database in Python
* Analysis of Premier League over 8 seasons
* Will definitely revisit multiple times for other correlation exploration and match predicting

### [Predicting No-Show Patients](https://github.com/EricArthur/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/No-Show%20Doctor%20Appointments/Medical%20Appointments.ipynb)
* EDA of medical appointment dataset originally from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments)
* Study looks into several factors affecting whether patients will show up for appointment or not
* For now is more of a data visualization exercise: will revisit to utilize machine learning to accurately predict no-shows
